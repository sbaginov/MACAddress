# MACAddress
Genuino/Arduino Library to generate and operate on and with MAC addresses. The original purpose was to use it in a sort of massive firmware project on a MEGA or a Nano where a few customizations were to be automatically accomplished based on different static IP addresses. The main class then evolved on its own and now supports initialization from array of chars, ints, strings and single octets. A MAC address can be easily printed to streams, converted to chars according to canonical usage, casted to an array of ints and even produce a compressed array of chars in case of leading zeros.
Single octets may be changed using the array notation, the extension id may be easily requested and set according to the 24, 28 and 36 bits length and a few operations such as comparisons for equality and inequality, addition and subtraction are supported.
The library may be larger than probably most of us would ever need, but in some cases it can be really helpful not to worry about conversions, memory allocation or whatever. Any feedback on its usage is and will be always greatly appreciated.
